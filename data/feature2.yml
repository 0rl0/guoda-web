      I find vector illustrations mesmerizing. I’ve learnt quite a lot this year, from fundamentals such as shapes and color to efficiency while working with Adobe Illustrator. I love to research, therefore, whether I am stuck at some part, I find the solution online.

      Animation tackled my curiosity when After Effects animation course appeared on my dashboard at online course website. As I’ve mentioned before, I find it exciting to learn a new skill, so making the animation you see at the beginning of my website was really fun!
